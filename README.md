## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- BEM Notation
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned how to map the ratings array and customize it in the CSS. Also, I was able to style the project with relative ease due to the help of BEM notation. 

### Continued development

In the future, I will start perojects with Mobile-First Workflow. I will also try to develop this project by adding the orange active states on the buttons.
